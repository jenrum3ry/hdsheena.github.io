# Copilot Instructions for hdsheena.github.io

## Project Overview
This is a GitHub Pages repository hosting a static website built from a React Native application using Expo web export.

## Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo)
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript (exported from Expo)
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Build Process
The build process follows these steps:
1. Download project zip from Replit
2. Extract the files
3. From base directory, run: `npx expo export --platform web`
4. Take the generated `index.html` file and add the Smartlook snippet
5. Replace files in this repository
6. Refresh hdsheena.github.io to see changes

## Key Commands
- Build for web: `npx expo export --platform web`
- No local development server (built via Replit)

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main entry point with embedded styles
- `static/` - Static assets (JS bundles, media files)
  - `static/js/` - JavaScript bundles
  - `static/media/` - Media assets
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `serve.json` - Serving configuration
- `asset-manifest.json` - Asset mappings
- `favicon-*.png`, `favicon.ico` - Site icons
- `blog/` - Blog content
- `pwa/` - Progressive Web App assets

## Restrictions
- **Do not modify** the contents of `static/` directory - these are auto-generated by Expo
- **Do not modify** `asset-manifest.json` - this is auto-generated
- Be careful when editing `index.html` - preserve the Smartlook snippet if present
- Do not add Node.js dependencies or package.json unless there's a specific need

## Deployment
- This is a GitHub Pages site
- Changes pushed to the main branch are automatically deployed
- The site is accessible at https://hdsheena.github.io

## Best Practices
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Preserve existing build artifacts
- Maintain the current build workflow (Replit → Expo export → GitHub)
- Do not introduce unnecessary complexity
- Test changes locally before committing (if possible)

## Notes
- The project originates from Replit
- Expo is used only for web export, not for the full development environment
- The site is static HTML/JS/CSS after export
