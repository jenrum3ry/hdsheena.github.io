            <p><strong>The Post:</strong> <em>"My dog is getting older and has started showing some stiffness after exercise, with occasional limping. I’m thinking about trying CBD oil to help keep her comfortable, but I don’t know much about it yet. Where do people usually buy it, and how do you figure out an appropriate dose? Adding a photo for visibility."</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> This question comes up a lot, and while the responses are usually well-intentioned, it touches on several important issues. I ended up writing a full article to explain them rather than repeating the same explanation each time.</p>
            
            <h2>Level 1: You've Diagnosed a Symptom, Not a Problem</h2>
            
            <p>"stiffness after exercise" and "occasional limping" are <strong>clinical signs</strong>, not a diagnosis. They tell you nothing about:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Which structure is painful (joint? tendon? ligament? bone? nerve?)</li>
                <li>What's causing the pain (osteoarthritis? soft tissue injury? bone cancer? tick-borne disease? autoimmune disorder?)</li>
                <li>How severe the damage is</li>
                <li>Whether rest, medication, surgery, or something else is appropriate</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>"Limping" in a senior dog can be anything from mild arthritis to osteosarcoma to a ruptured cruciate ligament to Lyme disease. These require radically different treatments. <strong>Some are time-sensitive.</strong></p>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>🚨 Red Flag: Limping Can Be Serious</h3>
                <p>Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) is common in large-breed senior dogs and often presents as gradual lameness. If you waste weeks on CBD while cancer spreads, you've lost precious time. A vet visit with radiographs can rule this out quickly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Level 2: CBD Oil Is Not Pain Management</h2>
            
            <p>CBD oil may have a <em>role</em> in chronic pain management—as one piece of a multi-modal approach, under veterinary supervision. What it is not:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A primary analgesic (pain reliever)</li>
                <li>A replacement for evidence-based pain medications like NSAIDs or gabapentinoids (see <a href="multi-modal-pain-management-medications.html">Multi-Modal Pain Management: Medications</a> for what actually works)</li>
                <li>A diagnostic tool</li>
                <li>A cure for whatever is causing your dog's pain</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00165/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cornell study</a> everyone cites showed dogs with osteoarthritis had improved mobility scores when CBD was added to their existing treatment. Key words: <strong>added to</strong>. Not "instead of." Not "by itself." And critically: they had a <em>diagnosis</em> of osteoarthritis first.</p>
            
            <p>If your dog has meaningful pain, they likely need actual medications—NSAIDs, gabapentin or pregabalin, amantadine, or newer options like <a href="https://www.zoetisus.com/products/dogs/librela" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Librela</a>. These require veterinary prescription and monitoring. (See <a href="multi-modal-pain-management-medications.html">Multi-Modal Pain Management: Medications</a> for the full breakdown.)</p>
            
            <h2>Level 3: You Don't Know What You're Buying (And You're Probably Breaking the Law)</h2>
            
            <p>Here's the brutal truth: In Canada, there are <strong>zero</strong> Health Canada-approved CBD drugs for animals. This means every bottle of "Pet CBD" you see in a pet store, gas station, or unauthorized website is an illegal, unregulated grey-market product.</p>
            
            <p>These products are not subject to federal testing or oversight. Studies have repeatedly found that unregulated CBD products often contain:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Less CBD than the label claims (sometimes zero)</li>
                <li>More THC than the label claims (THC is toxic to dogs)</li>
                <li>Contaminants (pesticides, heavy metals, solvents, mold)</li>
                <li>Wildly inconsistent batch-to-batch dosing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When you buy "Pet CBD" from an unregulated source, you are trusting a random company to not poison your dog. There is no government oversight ensuring product safety or accuracy.</p>
            
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>The Canadian Solution: Buy Human CBD from Licensed Retailers</h3>
                <p>If you're going to use CBD (under veterinary supervision, added to appropriate baseline pain medications), buy it from provincially licensed cannabis retailers like OCS (Ontario), BC Cannabis Stores, or equivalent provincial retailers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why human-grade cannabis products?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regulated Supply Chain:</strong> Health Canada strictly regulates human cannabis products</li>
                    <li><strong>Guaranteed Chemistry:</strong> If the label says 20mg/ml CBD, federal law ensures it actually contains 20mg/ml</li>
                    <li><strong>Mandatory Safety Testing:</strong> All products must be tested for pesticides, mold, heavy metals, and residual solvents</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistent Dosing:</strong> Each batch is verified, not guesswork</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>⚠️ Critical: How to Buy Human CBD Safely for Your Dog</h3>
                <p>You cannot just buy "whatever" human CBD product. Many contain high THC or additives that are safe for humans but toxic to dogs. Follow these rules:</p>
                
                <p><strong>1. Buy CBD Isolate Only</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look specifically for <strong>CBD Isolate</strong> oils (not "full spectrum" or "broad spectrum")</li>
                    <li>Check the legal label—it should read:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>THC:</strong> &lt; 1 mg/g (or "ND" - Non-Detectable)</li>
                            <li><strong>CBD:</strong> Your desired potency (usually 20-50 mg/g)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>2. Life-or-Death Ingredient Check</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>NO Xylitol:</strong> This artificial sweetener causes rapid liver failure in dogs. Found in some human elixirs and edibles. FATAL.</li>
                    <li><strong>NO Added Terpenes/Flavors:</strong> Buy "Unflavored" or "Natural" only. Human additives like peppermint oil or citrus terpenes can cause GI distress or toxicity</li>
                    <li><strong>Carrier Oil:</strong> Most legal Canadian oils use MCT oil (coconut derivative), which is generally safe for dogs (may cause loose stool if you start too high)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>3. Do the Math and Use Proper Measuring</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Human products are concentrated (e.g., 30mg/ml or 50mg/ml)</li>
                    <li><strong>Calculate carefully:</strong> If your dog needs 5mg and your oil is 50mg/ml, that's <strong>0.1 ml</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Buy a 1ml oral syringe</strong> from a pharmacy—bottle droppers are inaccurate</li>
                    <li>Never guess. Get the dose right.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Level 4: "What Dose Do I Give?" Is the Wrong Question</h2>
            
            <p>The fact that you're asking strangers for dosing advice for a product you haven't purchased for a condition you haven't diagnosed tells me everything about where this is headed.</p>
            
            <p>Even if CBD were appropriate for your dog's (undiagnosed) condition:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Dosing depends on the <em>concentration</em> of the specific product</li>
                <li>Dosing depends on your dog's <em>weight</em></li>
                <li>Dosing depends on what <em>other medications</em> your dog is on (CBD affects liver metabolism)</li>
                <li>Dosing depends on whether your dog has <em>liver or kidney disease</em></li>
                <li>Effective dosing ranges from 1-5mg/kg twice daily—that's a 5x range</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The answer to "what dose" is: <strong>Whatever your veterinarian recommends after examining your dog and reviewing their bloodwork.</strong></p>
            
            <h2>Level 5: You're Delaying Real Help</h2>
            
            <p>Here's the part that actually makes me angry.</p>
            
            <p>Your dog is telling you something is wrong. They're sore. They're limping. That's your dog communicating the only way they can: <strong>"This hurts."</strong></p>
            
            <p>And the response is to crowdsource supplement recommendations from strangers instead of going to someone who can actually examine the dog, diagnose the problem, and provide effective treatment?</p>
            
            <p>I understand veterinary care is expensive. I understand people feel overwhelmed. I understand the appeal of a "natural" option you can buy online without an appointment.</p>
            
            <p>But your dog is in pain <em>right now</em>. Every day you spend waiting for Amazon deliveries and titrating up unregulated supplements is a day your dog spends uncomfortable—or a day a serious condition progresses.</p>
            
            <h2>What You Should Actually Do</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make a vet appointment.</strong> Not eventually. Now. Describe exactly what you're seeing: "sore after walks, occasional limping, started [timeframe]."</li>
                <li><strong>Get diagnostics.</strong> At minimum, a physical exam. Probably radiographs. Maybe bloodwork depending on what's found.</li>
                <li><strong>Get a diagnosis.</strong> What structure is affected? What's the underlying cause?</li>
                <li><strong>Discuss pain management options.</strong> This might include NSAIDs, gabapentin, adequan, Librela, physical therapy, weight management—and yes, possibly CBD as an adjunct.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor and adjust.</strong> Pain management is ongoing. Use the tools in <a href="quality-of-life-assessments.html">Quality of Life Assessments</a> to track whether treatment is working.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>Can't Afford a Full Workup?</h3>
                <p>Be honest with your vet about budget constraints. Many will work with you to prioritize: "Given the budget, let's start with radiographs of that leg and a basic exam, and we'll go from there." Something is better than nothing, and nothing is what you get from Facebook recommendations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>The Role CBD <em>Can</em> Play</h2>
            
            <p>To be clear: I'm not saying CBD is useless. In <a href="case-study-reikers-palliative-timeline.html">Reiker's palliative protocol</a>, CBD was part of his multi-modal regimen. It was added after he was on an NSAID, pregabalin, and acetaminophen—and it was added under veterinary guidance with monitoring.</p>
            
            <p>CBD may help with:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Mild anxiety</li>
                <li>Supplemental anti-inflammatory effects</li>
                <li>Possibly some analgesic contribution (evidence is mixed)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>CBD is a reasonable <em>addition</em> to a pain plan. It is not a pain plan.</p>
            
            <h2>Summary: What's Wrong with "Where Do I Buy CBD?"</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>No diagnosis:</strong> You don't know what's causing the pain</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong treatment:</strong> CBD alone doesn't effectively manage pain</li>
                <li><strong>Unregulated products:</strong> You have no idea what you're actually giving</li>
                <li><strong>No dosing guidance:</strong> Strangers can't dose your specific dog</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed care:</strong> Your dog suffers while you experiment</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Your dog deserves better than crowdsourced healthcare. Go to the vet.</p>
