            <p><strong>The Post:</strong> <em>"My dog is getting older and has started showing some stiffness after exercise, with occasional limping. I’m thinking about trying CBD oil to help keep her comfortable, but I don’t know much about it yet. Where do people usually buy it, and how do you figure out an appropriate dose? Adding a photo for visibility."</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> This question comes up a lot, and while the responses are usually well-intentioned, it touches on several important issues. I ended up writing a full article to explain them rather than repeating the same explanation each time.</p>
            
            <h2>Level 1: You've Diagnosed a Symptom, Not a Problem</h2>
            
            <p>"stiffness after exercise" and "occasional limping" are <strong>clinical signs</strong>, not a diagnosis. They tell you nothing about:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Which structure is painful (joint? tendon? ligament? bone? nerve?)</li>
                <li>What's causing the pain (osteoarthritis? soft tissue injury? bone cancer? tick-borne disease? autoimmune disorder?)</li>
                <li>How severe the damage is</li>
                <li>Whether rest, medication, surgery, or something else is appropriate</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>"Limping" in a senior dog can be anything from mild arthritis to osteosarcoma to a ruptured cruciate ligament to Lyme disease. These require radically different treatments. <strong>Some are time-sensitive.</strong></p>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>🚨 Red Flag: Limping Can Be Serious</h3>
                <p>Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) is common in large-breed senior dogs and often presents as gradual lameness. If you waste weeks on CBD while cancer spreads, you've lost precious time. A vet visit with radiographs can rule this out quickly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Level 2: CBD Oil Is Not Pain Management</h2>
            
            <p>CBD oil may have a <em>role</em> in chronic pain management—as one piece of a multi-modal approach, under veterinary supervision. What it is not:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A primary analgesic (pain reliever)</li>
                <li>A replacement for evidence-based pain medications like NSAIDs or gabapentinoids (see <a href="multi-modal-pain-management.html">Multi-Modal Pain Management</a> for what actually works)</li>
                <li>A diagnostic tool</li>
                <li>A cure for whatever is causing your dog's pain</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00165/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cornell study</a> everyone cites showed dogs with osteoarthritis had improved mobility scores when CBD was added to their existing treatment. Key words: <strong>added to</strong>. Not "instead of." Not "by itself." And critically: they had a <em>diagnosis</em> of osteoarthritis first.</p>
            
            <p>If your dog has meaningful pain, they likely need actual medications—NSAIDs, gabapentin or pregabalin, amantadine, or newer options like <a href="https://www.zoetisus.com/products/dogs/librela" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Librela</a>. These require veterinary prescription and monitoring. (See <a href="multi-modal-pain-management.html">Multi-Modal Pain Management</a> for the full breakdown.)</p>
            
            <h2>Level 3: You Don't Know What You're Buying</h2>
            
            <p>Pet CBD is an unregulated Wild West. Studies have repeatedly found that CBD products often contain:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Less CBD than the label claims (sometimes zero)</li>
                <li>More THC than the label claims (THC is toxic to dogs)</li>
                <li>Contaminants (pesticides, heavy metals, solvents)</li>
                <li>Wildly inconsistent batch-to-batch dosing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When you ask Facebook "where do you buy it from," you're asking strangers to recommend products in an industry with no quality standards, no oversight, and no accountability.</p>
            
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>If You're Going to Use CBD Anyway</h3>
                <p>At minimum, demand a <strong>Certificate of Analysis (COA)</strong> from a third-party lab showing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actual CBD content matches the label</li>
                    <li>THC content is below 0.3% (or ideally undetectable)</li>
                    <li>No pesticides, heavy metals, or microbial contamination</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a company can't provide a current COA for their batch, don't buy it.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Level 4: "What Dose Do I Give?" Is the Wrong Question</h2>
            
            <p>The fact that you're asking strangers for dosing advice for a product you haven't purchased for a condition you haven't diagnosed tells me everything about where this is headed.</p>
            
            <p>Even if CBD were appropriate for your dog's (undiagnosed) condition:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Dosing depends on the <em>concentration</em> of the specific product</li>
                <li>Dosing depends on your dog's <em>weight</em></li>
                <li>Dosing depends on what <em>other medications</em> your dog is on (CBD affects liver metabolism)</li>
                <li>Dosing depends on whether your dog has <em>liver or kidney disease</em></li>
                <li>Effective dosing ranges from 1-5mg/kg twice daily—that's a 5x range</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The answer to "what dose" is: <strong>Whatever your veterinarian recommends after examining your dog and reviewing their bloodwork.</strong></p>
            
            <h2>Level 5: You're Delaying Real Help</h2>
            
            <p>Here's the part that actually makes me angry.</p>
            
            <p>Your dog is telling you something is wrong. They're sore. They're limping. That's your dog communicating the only way they can: <strong>"This hurts."</strong></p>
            
            <p>And the response is to crowdsource supplement recommendations from strangers instead of going to someone who can actually examine the dog, diagnose the problem, and provide effective treatment?</p>
            
            <p>I understand veterinary care is expensive. I understand people feel overwhelmed. I understand the appeal of a "natural" option you can buy online without an appointment.</p>
            
            <p>But your dog is in pain <em>right now</em>. Every day you spend waiting for Amazon deliveries and titrating up unregulated supplements is a day your dog spends uncomfortable—or a day a serious condition progresses.</p>
            
            <h2>What You Should Actually Do</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make a vet appointment.</strong> Not eventually. Now. Describe exactly what you're seeing: "sore after walks, occasional limping, started [timeframe]."</li>
                <li><strong>Get diagnostics.</strong> At minimum, a physical exam. Probably radiographs. Maybe bloodwork depending on what's found.</li>
                <li><strong>Get a diagnosis.</strong> What structure is affected? What's the underlying cause?</li>
                <li><strong>Discuss pain management options.</strong> This might include NSAIDs, gabapentin, adequan, Librela, physical therapy, weight management—and yes, possibly CBD as an adjunct.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor and adjust.</strong> Pain management is ongoing. Use the tools in <a href="quality-of-life-assessments.html">Quality of Life Assessments</a> to track whether treatment is working.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>Can't Afford a Full Workup?</h3>
                <p>Be honest with your vet about budget constraints. Many will work with you to prioritize: "Given the budget, let's start with radiographs of that leg and a basic exam, and we'll go from there." Something is better than nothing, and nothing is what you get from Facebook recommendations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>The Role CBD <em>Can</em> Play</h2>
            
            <p>To be clear: I'm not saying CBD is useless. In <a href="case-study-reikers-palliative-timeline.html">Reiker's palliative protocol</a>, CBD was part of his multi-modal regimen. It was added after he was on an NSAID, pregabalin, and acetaminophen—and it was added under veterinary guidance with monitoring.</p>
            
            <p>CBD may help with:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Mild anxiety</li>
                <li>Supplemental anti-inflammatory effects</li>
                <li>Possibly some analgesic contribution (evidence is mixed)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>CBD is a reasonable <em>addition</em> to a pain plan. It is not a pain plan.</p>
            
            <h2>Summary: What's Wrong with "Where Do I Buy CBD?"</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>No diagnosis:</strong> You don't know what's causing the pain</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong treatment:</strong> CBD alone doesn't effectively manage pain</li>
                <li><strong>Unregulated products:</strong> You have no idea what you're actually giving</li>
                <li><strong>No dosing guidance:</strong> Strangers can't dose your specific dog</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed care:</strong> Your dog suffers while you experiment</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Your dog deserves better than crowdsourced healthcare. Go to the vet.</p>
