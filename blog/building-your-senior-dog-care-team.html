            <p>Strong veterinary partners can optimize your senior dog's quality of life. Finding professionals who understand palliative care philosophy is essential.</p>
            
            <h2 id="palliative-care">Understanding Palliative Care for Pets</h2>
            
            <p>Palliative care focuses on comfort, quality of life, and symptom management. Unlike hospice care (end-of-life care in final weeks/days), palliative care can span months or years.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Core principles:</strong></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritizing comfort and function over diagnostic pursuit</li>
                <li>Managing pain and other symptoms proactively</li>
                <li>Supporting both the patient and the family</li>
                <li>Focusing on what the dog can still do and enjoy</li>
                <li>Making decisions based on quality of life rather than quantity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="primary-vet">Your Primary Veterinarian: The Foundation</h2>
            
            <p>Your primary vet is the cornerstone of your team. As your dog ages, reassess whether your current practice can meet evolving needs.</p>
