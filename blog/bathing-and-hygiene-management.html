            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Immobile or incontinent senior dogs need regular bathing, but traditional tub baths are stressful and unsafe for geriatric patients with mobility issues.</p>
            
            <p>Waterless bathing systems allow thorough cleaning without the stress of lifting, standing in slippery tubs, or cold water shock. This approach maintains hygiene while protecting fragile joints and reducing anxiety.</p>
            
            <h2 id="setup">Water-Catching Setup</h2>
            
            <p>Creating a water-catching area prevents slipping hazards and makes cleanup manageable.</p>
            
            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Old shower curtain</strong> - Bottom waterproof layer</li>
                <li><strong>1-2 towels on top</strong> - Absorbent layer for comfort and water catching</li>
                <li><strong>Location</strong> - Bathroom floor, laundry room, or any washable surface</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>💡 Multi-Purpose Setup</h3>
                <p>This same setup works for both bladder expression and bathing. The shower curtain catches fluids, and towels provide absorbent padding for the dog's comfort.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="waterless">Waterless Shampoo Method</h2>
            
            <p>Enzymatic waterless shampoo cleans effectively without requiring a full rinse, making it ideal for senior dogs who can't tolerate traditional bathing.</p>
            
            <h3>Product Recommendation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://nelliesclean.ca/collections/pets/products/fresh-dog" target="_blank">Nellie's Clean Fresh Dog</a></strong> (Canadian brand)</li>
                <li>Enzyme-based formula - breaks down organic matter naturally</li>
                <li>Gentle on sensitive skin</li>
                <li>No harsh soaps or chemicals</li>
                <li>Minimal rinsing required (though rinsing is still preferred when possible)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>⚠️ Why Enzymatic?</h3>
                <p>Traditional shampoos require thorough rinsing to prevent skin irritation. Enzymatic formulas use biological cleaning action, meaning residue is less problematic if full rinsing isn't feasible for your dog's condition.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="three-cloth">The 3-Cloth Bathing System</h2>
            
            <p>This systematic approach ensures thorough cleaning while minimizing the number of wet cloths needed and preventing cross-contamination.</p>
            
            <h3>What You Need</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3+ clean washcloths per bath</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Pail of warm water</strong> (comfortable temperature - test on your wrist)</li>
                <li><strong>Waterless enzymatic shampoo</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Dry towels for final stage</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Dirty cloth pile</strong> nearby</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Pre-Rinse Cloth (Water Only)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wet cloth with warm water only</li>
                <li>Purpose: Remove solids, debris, and pre-wet the fur</li>
                <li>Gently wipe the area to be cleaned</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="important-box">
                <h3>🚨 Critical Hygiene Rule</h3>
                <p><strong>If cleaning fecal matter:</strong> The cloth goes STRAIGHT into the dirty pile after that area. Get a fresh cloth for the next area. Never reuse a cloth that touched feces on another body part.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Step 2: Shampoo Cloth (Scrubbing)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wet cloth with warm water, then wring out excess</li>
                <li>Spray waterless shampoo directly on the dog (when possible)</li>
                <li>For sensitive areas (face, genitals): Spray shampoo onto the cloth directly</li>
                <li>Scrub thoroughly - enzymes need contact time to work</li>
                <li>Pay attention to skin folds, under legs, and areas of urine/fecal contact</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Step 3: Rinse Cloth (Water Only)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh wet cloth, water only</li>
                <li>Wipe away shampoo residue</li>
                <li>Multiple passes if needed for thorough rinsing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>Note: Enzymatic shampoo technically doesn't require rinsing, but rinsing is still preferred when feasible to prevent any potential residue buildup or skin sensitivity.</em></p>
            
            <h3>Step 4: Absorption Cloth (Dry Towel)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use dry cloth/towel to sop up as much water as possible</li>
                <li>Press firmly to absorb moisture from fur</li>
                <li>Once the towel is saturated, toss it in the dirty pile</li>
                <li>Alternatively: Use the saturated towel as your next "wet rinse cloth" (efficiency hack)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="drying">Drying and Skin Care</h2>
            
            <p>Incomplete drying creates conditions for skin infections, especially under mobility harnesses or in skin folds.</p>
            
            <h3>Forced Air Dryer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> Pet-specific forced air dryer (not a human hair dryer)</li>
                <li>Blows room-temperature or slightly warm air at high velocity</li>
                <li>Penetrates undercoat to dry skin layer</li>
                <li>Much faster than towel-drying alone</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>⚠️ CRITICAL: Skin Must Be Completely Dry</h3>
                <p>Before putting on any mobility harness, sling, or support gear, ensure the skin underneath is <strong>completely dry</strong>. Trapped moisture + friction = pressure sores, hot spots, and fungal infections.</p>
                <p>If the dog uses a harness 24/7, consider allowing 30+ minutes of "naked" time post-bath for thorough air drying before re-harnessing.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>High-Risk Areas</h3>
            <p>Pay extra attention to drying these zones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Under harness straps (chest, belly, rear legs)</li>
                <li>Groin/genital area</li>
                <li>Armpits</li>
                <li>Skin folds (facial wrinkles, tail base)</li>
                <li>Between toes (especially if using boots)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Managing Heavy Soiling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For diarrhea: Pre-rinse with multiple water-only cloths before introducing shampoo</li>
                <li>Keep a spray bottle of diluted enzymatic cleaner for pre-treating stubborn areas</li>
                <li>Consider trimming fur around the anus/genitals to reduce contamination ("sanitary trim")</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Frequency Guidelines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spot cleaning:</strong> Daily as needed (perineal area for incontinent dogs)</li>
                <li><strong>Full body bath:</strong> Weekly or as needed based on soiling</li>
                <li><strong>After bladder expression:</strong> Quick wipe-down of rear area</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Supplies Organization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep a dedicated "bath bin" with pre-stocked cloths, shampoo, and towels</li>
                <li>Having everything ready reduces stress for both you and the dog</li>
                <li>Consider multiple setups in different rooms if your dog has limited mobility</li>
            </ul>
