            <p><strong>The Misconception:</strong> Sweaters and booties are for small, pampered dogs.</p>
            <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Thermoregulation is a medical necessity for the geriatric patient.</p>
            
            <p>As dogs age, they suffer from <strong>sarcopenia</strong> (muscle wasting). Muscle is a primary generator of body heat and a layer of insulation. When that muscle fades, your dog loses the ability to stay warm. Conversely, compromised respiratory systems and obesity make them intolerant to heat.</p>
            
            <p>If your dog is shivering, they are burning calories they cannot spare. If they are panting excessively, they are stressing a fragile heart. "Comfort" is not a luxury; it is the management of metabolic energy.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Footwear: Traction & Protection</h2>
            
            <p>For dogs with neurodegenerative myelopathy (DM) or generalized weakness, boots serve two technical functions: <strong>traction</strong> (preventing the "Bambi on ice" splay) and <strong>abrasion resistance</strong> (preventing bleeding toes from dragging).</p>
            
            <h3>The Gear: Neopaws</h3>
            
            <p>Do not buy cheap balloons or thin socks for outdoors. For a high-drive working dog, you need orthopedic-grade footwear.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Summer: <a href="https://neopaws.com/">Neopaws Summer Shoes (Mesh)</a></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Function:</em> Breathable upper prevents overheating while the heavy-duty rubber sole protects against hot pavement and provides grip.</li>
                        <li><em>Application:</em> Essential for dragging feet on concrete. If they knuckle, they will grind their nails down to the quick without this barrier.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Winter: <a href="https://neopaws.com/">Neopaws Winter Shoes (Neoprene)</a></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Function:</em> Insulation and waterproofing. Snow accumulation between toes causes ice balls, which act like rocks in a shoe.</li>
                        <li><em>Application:</em> Required for any temperature below freezing if the dog has reduced circulation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>2. Heat Management (Winter & Night)</h2>
            
            <p>Arthritic joints stiffen in the cold. A cold dog is a painful dog.</p>
            
            <h3>The Heated Bed</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Tool:</strong> Electric Heated Pet Mat (e.g., standard Amazon models with chew-resistant cords).</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Senior dogs are sedentary. They do not generate heat through movement. A passive heat source prevents stiffness overnight.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Place this <em>on top</em> of their orthopedic bed. Ensure there is a "cool zone" they can move to if they get too warm.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Wearables (Jackets & PJs)</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indoors: Fleece pajamas / "Onesies"</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Function:</em> 24/7 insulation for sarcopenic dogs.</li>
                        <li><em>Benefit:</em> Keeps the hips and spine warm, keeping the synovial fluid in the joints less viscous.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Outdoors: Insulated Parkas (e.g., <a href="https://www.hurtta.com/">Hurtta</a> or similar)</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Rule of Thumb:</em> If you need a coat, they need a coat.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>3. Cooling Management (Summer)</h2>
            
            <p>Heatstroke kills senior dogs faster than cold does. Their laryngeal function often declines, making panting less effective.</p>
            
            <h3>The Cooling Vest</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Mechanism:</strong> Evaporative Cooling. You soak the vest in water; as it evaporates, it pulls heat from the dog's core.</li>
                <li><strong>The Limit:</strong> These only work in low-to-moderate humidity. In high humidity, they become a wet blanket.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Keep the vest wet. If it dries out, it becomes an insulator and will <em>cook</em> the dog. Re-wet with a water bottle every 30 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>Critical Warning: Cooling Vest Safety</h3>
                <p>A dry cooling vest becomes an insulator that <strong>traps heat</strong>. If you cannot commit to re-wetting it every 30 minutes, remove it. A dry vest in hot weather can cause hyperthermia.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The "Cooling Mat" (Gel)</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Pressure-activated gel mats provide instant relief for about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Keep one in the car and one in the living room.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Summary: The Environmental Audit</h2>
            
            <p>Walk through your house and look at it as a hazard zone.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Is the floor slippery?</strong> Boots or runners.</li>
                <li><strong>Is the draft cold?</strong> Heated bed or PJs.</li>
                <li><strong>Is the pavement hot?</strong> Summer boots.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>You are not dressing your dog up. You are managing their environment because their body can no longer do it for them.</p>
