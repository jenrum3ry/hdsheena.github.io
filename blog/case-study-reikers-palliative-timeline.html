            <div class="important-box">
                <p><strong>Patient:</strong> Reiker (Belgian Malinois, 15 years old)</p>
                <p><strong>Diagnoses:</strong> Neurodegenerative myelopathy (suspected DM), Osteoarthritis, Sarcopenia</p>
                <p><strong>Primary Care Team:</strong> Dr. Andrew Reid & Dr. Fiona Reid (Oriole Road), Dr. Allen Jacobson (Sitara)</p>
                <p><strong>Care Goal:</strong> "Full comfort care" with a specific focus on his "Desire to bite" (Play drive)</p>
            </div>

            <p>When we talk about "palliative care," it often feels abstract. Below is the exact, unvarnished timeline of Reiker's medication, decline, and death. This is not a prescription guide; it is a record of how we chased comfort for a high-drive dog whose body was failing his mind, and how specific advocacy bought him high-quality years, not just months.</p>

            <h2>Phase 0: The Baseline Years (2018 – 2022)</h2>
            <p><em>Establishing Baselines & Managing Acute Events</em></p>

            <p>Before the neurodegeneration took hold, Reiker was managed for orthopedic maintenance and "Malinois" anxiety. The key here was establishing healthy baseline bloodwork, which allowed us to be aggressive with medications later in life.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>April 2021 (Lump Removal):</strong> Post-op recovery utilized <strong>Trazodone</strong> heavily to manage activity restriction—early proof that sedation was a kindness for him, not a punishment.</li>
                <li><strong>July 2022 (The Broken Canine):</strong> While waiting for dental surgery, pain was managed with <strong>300mg Gabapentin BID</strong> and <strong>Meloxicam</strong>. His geriatric blood panel at this time was "pretty great," confirming his liver and kidneys could handle long-term NSAIDs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phase 1: The "Normal" Senior Years (2023 – 2024)</h2>
            <p><em>Transitioning from Acute to Chronic Care</em></p>

            <p>This period marked the shift to daily management. We trialed "gold standard" drugs, and when they failed, we moved on quickly.</p>

            <h3>March 2023 (The Librela Trial)</h3>
            <p>Reiker received monthly Librela injections for osteoarthritis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> By July 3, 2023, you noted: <em>"Didn't see any effects."</em></li>
                <li><strong>The Lesson:</strong> This "failed trial" was critical data. It proved his pain wasn't purely NGF-driven (inflammatory), suggesting a neuropathic or central component. We stopped the drug and pivoted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>July 2023 (Poly-Pharmacy Begins)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gabapentin:</strong> 300mg daily</li>
                <li><strong>Acetaminophen:</strong> Added BID (Twice Daily) to target non-inflammatory pain</li>
                <li><strong>Cartrophen:</strong> Restarted weekly loading doses for joint health</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phase 2: The "Wobble" & Aggressive Escalation (Early 2025)</h2>
            <p><em>The Turning Point: Managing Side Effects via Email</em></p>

            <p>In <strong>February 2025</strong>, Reiker experienced a distinct decline in stability (ataxia/knuckling). We did not "wait and see." We utilized email to rapid-fire adjust his protocol without the stress of daily clinic visits.</p>

            <h3>1. The Amantadine Pivot (March 2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>March 13 (Email):</strong> You requested to add <strong>Amantadine</strong> (an NMDA antagonist) to target wind-up pain.</li>
                <li><strong>The Reaction:</strong> Reiker developed vomiting and acute liquid diarrhea shortly after starting.</li>
                <li><strong>The Pivot:</strong> Dr. Reid advised via email to pause, treat symptomatically, and restart later at a lower dose.</li>
                <li><strong>Takeaway:</strong> This adverse event didn't mean we stopped; it meant we paused and recalibrated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Ketamine Therapy (Spring 2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> 0.5mg/kg Subcutaneous (SQ) injections</li>
                <li><strong>The Frequency Adjustment (May 21 Email):</strong> You noticed the monthly shots were wearing off after 3 weeks. You emailed: <em>"I'd like to try it again at the 14 day mark."</em></li>
                <li><strong>The Vet Response:</strong> <em>"No problem with trying q 2 weeks."</em></li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> By October, you were administering <strong>weekly</strong> injections to maintain his mobility.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Key Advocacy Moment</h3>
                <p>This email-based adjustment demonstrates effective owner-veterinarian communication. Rather than waiting for the next scheduled appointment, observing the duration of benefit and requesting frequency changes based on functional decline allowed for real-time optimization of therapy.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Phase 3: The "Rollercoaster" (Spring – Fall 2025)</h2>
            <p><em>Managing Crises & Tracking "Good Days"</em></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Crisis (April 11, 2025):</strong> A low point involving GI issues and ataxia. Euthanasia was discussed.</li>
                <li><strong>The Rally:</strong> By <strong>April 12</strong>, logs note <em>"Doing ok!"</em> This "near-death" dip followed by a rally is classic in palliative trajectories. Because we had the medications on board (Acetaminophen, Ketamine, Gabapentin), he bounced back for another 8 months of quality time.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>The Data</h3>
                <p>From Oct 28, 2025, to Jan 2, 2026, we tracked 28 distinct days:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Good Days:</strong> 22</li>
                    <li><strong>Neutral Days:</strong> 6</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad Days:</strong> 0 recorded in that batch</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This tracking provided objective evidence that quality of life remained acceptable through this period.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Phase 4: The Terminal Phase (January 2026)</h2>
            <p><em>The End of the Runway</em></p>

            <p>By January, the neurodegeneration overwhelmed the pharmacological support. The "Desire to Bite" metric—his primary joy—collapsed.</p>

            <h3>January 7, 2026 (The "Hail Mary" Email)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Status:</strong> You wrote, <em>"He's lost almost all function in his hind legs... drag behind him pads-up."</em></li>
                <li><strong>The Proposal:</strong> <em>"I'd like to request a single dose... of <strong>methadone</strong> to try at home... If he shows me that much of what I'm seeing is pain... at least I'll know."</em></li>
                <li><strong>The Vet Response:</strong> Dr. Reid agreed to a home trial of subcutaneous Methadone (0.23ml q8h).</li>
                <li><strong>The Result:</strong> The Methadone provided profound sedation and comfort, but it confirmed the functional deficits were permanent. The "pain" was managed, but the "body" was gone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>January 10, 2026 (Metric Failure)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scored <strong>2/5 (Agree)</strong> on "Does not want to play"</li>
                <li>Scored <strong>1/5 (Strongly Agree)</strong> on "Does not enjoy same activities"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When the primary quality-of-life metric—play drive—consistently failed, the decision became clear.</p>

            <h2>The End (January 13, 2026)</h2>

            <p>Reiker was euthanized on Tuesday, January 13, 2026, at Oriole Road Animal Hospital.</p>

            <div class="important-box">
                <h3>Summary of What Bought Us Time</h3>
                <p>Reiker lived nearly a full year after his first major "wobble" in February 2025. That year was bought with:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Acetaminophen:</strong> Cheap, effective, and started <em>early</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Ketamine:</strong> The "heavy hitter" for central sensitization, adjusted by owner observation</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> The "Amantadine failure" and "Methadone Trial" were not mistakes; they were diagnostics run via email to get immediate answers</li>
                    <li><strong>Objective Tracking:</strong> Good day/bad day calendars provided data, not just emotion</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Metrics:</strong> "Desire to bite" as the primary quality-of-life indicator gave us an objective endpoint</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h2>Clinical Lessons from Reiker's Case</h2>

            <h3>1. Failed Trials Are Data, Not Failures</h3>
            <p>The Librela trial "failed," but it gave us critical information about the nature of his pain. Don't view unsuccessful medication trials as setbacks—they narrow the diagnostic field.</p>

            <h3>2. Email-Based Protocol Adjustments Work</h3>
            <p>The ketamine frequency adjustments and amantadine troubleshooting happened via email. This reduced clinic visits, stress, and allowed for real-time optimization based on owner observation.</p>

            <h3>3. The "Diagnostic Trial" of Methadone</h3>
            <p>At the very end, we used methadone not as a long-term solution, but as a diagnostic tool to differentiate pain from neurological decline. When function didn't improve despite profound analgesia, we had our answer.</p>

            <h3>4. Define Quality of Life in Advance</h3>
            <p>For Reiker, it was "Desire to bite." For other dogs, it might be greeting family at the door, eating enthusiastically, or sleeping comfortably. Whatever it is, define it early and track it objectively.</p>

                <figcaption class="memorial-caption">Reiker demonstrating his "Desire to bite" - the primary quality-of-life metric we tracked throughout his palliative journey.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>5. Aggressive Doesn't Mean Inappropriate</h3>
            <p>We used ketamine weekly, acetaminophen daily, and trialed multiple NMDA antagonists. This wasn't reckless—it was systematic, monitored, and based on function. Aggressive palliative care, when properly managed, extends quality time, not just survival.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>This Is Not a Prescription</h3>
                <p>Every case is different. Reiker's protocol worked for <em>his</em> presentation: neurodegenerative disease with preserved mentation but declining motor function. Your dog's situation, bloodwork, comorbidities, and quality-of-life metrics will be different. Use this case study as a framework for advocacy and communication, not as a medication checklist.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Use This Case Study</h2>

            <p>If you're facing a similar situation:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establish Baseline Bloodwork:</strong> Healthy kidneys and liver give you more pharmacological options later</li>
                <li><strong>Track Good Days vs. Bad Days:</strong> Use a calendar or app (like HosPet) to create objective data</li>
                <li><strong>Define Your Metric:</strong> What activity or behavior is non-negotiable for your dog's quality of life?</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate Frequently:</strong> Email your vet with observations. Good vets appreciate data-driven owners</li>
                <li><strong>Trial and Pivot:</strong> If a medication doesn't work, stop it and move on. Failed trials are still useful information</li>
                <li><strong>Know When to Stop:</strong> When your primary metric fails consistently, honor your dog by letting go</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Reiker's story is one of aggressive advocacy, systematic medication management, and ultimately, a peaceful end when function could no longer be restored. It wasn't perfect, but it was <em>data-driven</em>, and that made the hard decisions clearer.</p>
