                <p><strong>Patient:</strong> Reiker (Belgian Malinois, 15yo)</p>
                <p><strong>Diagnoses:</strong> Neurodegenerative myelopathy (suspected DM), Osteoarthritis, Sarcopenia</p>
                <p><strong>Care Team:</strong> Dr. Andrew Reid & Dr. Fiona Reid (Oriole Road), Dr. Allen Jacobson (Sitara)</p>
                <p><strong>QoL Metric:</strong> "Desire to bite" (Play drive)</p>
            </div>

            <p>Unvarnished timeline of medication, decline, death. Not prescription guide - record of how advocacy bought high-quality years.</p>

            <h2 id="phase0">Phase 0: Baseline Years (2018-2022)</h2>

            <p>Managed for orthopedic maintenance + anxiety. Key: healthy baseline bloodwork = aggressive med options later.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>April 2021 (Lump removal)</strong> - Post-op: Trazodone for activity restriction. Proof: sedation = kindness, not punishment</li>
                <li><strong>July 2022 (Broken canine)</strong> - Pre-dental: 300mg Gabapentin BID + Meloxicam. Geriatric panel "pretty great" = liver/kidneys can handle long-term NSAIDs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="phase1">Phase 1: Senior Years (2023-2024)</h2>
            
            <p>Shift to daily management. Trial, assess, pivot.</p>

            <h3>March 2023: Librela Trial</h3>
            <p>Monthly injections for OA.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result (July):</strong> "Didn't see effects"</li>
                <li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Failed trial = critical data. Pain not NGF-driven (inflammatory) → suggests neuropathic/central. Stop + pivot</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>July 2023: Poly-Pharmacy Begins</h3>
            <ul>

            <h2 id="phase2">Phase 2: Aggressive Escalation (Early 2025)</h2>
            
            <p><strong>February 2025:</strong> Decline in stability (ataxia/knuckling). No "wait and see." Email rapid-fire protocol adjustment.</p>

            <h3>1. Amantadine Pivot (March 2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>March 13 email:</strong> Request Amantadine (NMDA antagonist) for wind-up pain</li>
                <li><strong>Reaction:</strong> Vomiting, acute liquid diarrhea</li>
                <li><strong>Pivot:</strong> Dr. Reid email - pause, treat symptoms, restart lower dose later</li>
                <li><strong>Key:</strong> Adverse event ≠ stop. Pause + recalibrate</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Ketamine (Spring 2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> 0.5mg/kg SQ</li>
                <li><strong>May 21 email:</strong> Monthly shots wearing off after 3 weeks. "Try at 14 day mark?"</li>
                <li><strong>Vet:</strong> "No problem q 2 weeks"</li>
                <li><strong>October:</strong> <strong>Weekly</strong> injections to maintain mobility</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Key Advocacy Moment</h3>
                <p>Email-based adjustment = effective communication. Observed duration, requested frequency change based on functional decline = real-time therapy optimization.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="phase3">Phase 3: Rollercoaster (Spring-Fall 2025)</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>April 11 crisis:</strong> Low point (GI + ataxia). Euthanasia discussed</li>
                <li><strong>April 12 rally:</strong> "Doing ok!" Near-death dip → rally = classic palliative trajectory. Meds on board (Acetaminophen, Ketamine, Gabapentin) = bounce back for 8 more quality months</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>The Data (Oct 28, 2025 - Jan 2, 2026)</h3>
                <p>28 tracked days: 22 good, 6 neutral, 0 bad. Objective evidence QoL acceptable this period.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="phase4">Phase 4: Terminal Phase (January 2026)</h2>

            <p>By January, the neurodegeneration overwhelmed the pharmacological support. The "Desire to Bite" metric—his primary joy—collapsed.</p>

            <h3>January 7, 2026 (The "Hail Mary" Email)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Status:</strong> You wrote, <em>"He's lost almost all function in his hind legs... drag behind him pads-up."</em></li>
                <li><strong>The Proposal:</strong> <em>"I'd like to request a single dose... of <strong>methadone</strong> to try at home... If he shows me that much of what I'm seeing is pain... at least I'll know."</em></li>
                <li><strong>The Vet Response:</strong> Dr. Reid agreed to a home trial of subcutaneous Methadone (0.23ml q8h).</li>
                <li><strong>The Result:</strong> The Methadone provided profound sedation and comfort, but it confirmed the functional deficits were permanent. The "pain" was managed, but the "body" was gone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>January 10, 2026 (Metric Failure)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scored <strong>2/5 (Agree)</strong> on "Does not want to play"</li>
                <li>Scored <strong>1/5 (Strongly Agree)</strong> on "Does not enjoy same activities"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When the primary quality-of-life metric—play drive—consistently failed, the decision became clear.</p>

            <h2>The End (January 13, 2026)</h2>

            <p>Reiker was euthanized on Tuesday, January 13, 2026, at Oriole Road Animal Hospital.</p>

            <div class="important-box">
                <h3>Summary of What Bought Us Time</h3>
                <p>Reiker lived nearly a full year after his first major "wobble" in February 2025. That year was bought with:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Acetaminophen:</strong> Cheap, effective, and started <em>early</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Ketamine:</strong> The "heavy hitter" for central sensitization, adjusted by owner observation</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> The "Amantadine failure" and "Methadone Trial" were not mistakes; they were diagnostics run via email to get immediate answers</li>
                    <li><strong>Objective Tracking:</strong> Good day/bad day calendars provided data, not just emotion</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Metrics:</strong> "Desire to bite" as the primary quality-of-life indicator gave us an objective endpoint</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h2 id="lessons">Clinical Lessons from Reiker's Case</h2>

            <h3>1. Failed Trials Are Data</h3>
            <p>Librela "failed" but gave critical pain type information. Unsuccessful trials narrow diagnostic field, not setbacks.</p>

            <h3>2. Email Protocol Adjustments Work</h3>
            <p>Ketamine frequency + amantadine troubleshooting via email = reduced clinic visits/stress, real-time optimization from owner observation.</p>

            <h3>3. "Diagnostic Trial" of Methadone</h3>
            <p>Used at end as diagnostic to differentiate pain from neurological decline. Function didn't improve despite profound analgesia = answer clear.</p>

            <h3>4. Define QoL in Advance</h3>
            <p>For Reiker: "Desire to bite." For others: greeting family, eating enthusiastically, sleeping comfortably. Define early, track objectively.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>5. Aggressive ≠ Inappropriate</h3>
            <p>Ketamine weekly, acetaminophen daily, trialed multiple NMDA antagonists. Systematic, monitored, function-based. Aggressive palliative care when properly managed extends quality time, not just survival.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>Not a Prescription</h3>
                <p>Every case different. Reiker's protocol worked for <em>his</em> presentation: neurodegenerative disease with preserved mentation, declining motor function. Your dog's situation will differ. Use as framework for advocacy/communication, not medication checklist.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Use This Case Study</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Establish Baseline Bloodwork:</strong> Healthy kidneys/liver = more pharmacological options later</li>
                <li><strong>Track Good vs. Bad Days:</strong> Calendar or app creates objective data</li>
                <li><strong>Define Your Metric:</strong> What activity/behavior is non-negotiable for your dog's QoL?</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate Frequently:</strong> Email vet with observations. Good vets appreciate data-driven owners</li>
                <li><strong>Trial and Pivot:</strong> Medication doesn't work? Stop, move on. Failed trials = useful info</li>
                <li><strong>Know When to Stop:</strong> When primary metric fails consistently, honor your dog by letting go</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Reiker's story: aggressive advocacy, systematic medication management, peaceful end when function couldn't be restored. Not perfect, but <em>data-driven</em>—making hard decisions clearer.</p>
